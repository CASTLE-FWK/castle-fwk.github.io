## CAS and the Real World
<!--Intro-->
This is the first in a series of posts that discuss complex adaptive system theory, research, features, and other interesting aspects. This post focuses on the basics of complex adaptive systems, and how they exist in reality and why their study is valuable.

<!--Definition of a CAS-->
Complex adaptive systems, exist in every facet of life. From the more foundational aspects such as biological and chemical systems, to human made constructs such as the global economy and ****, to more recent technological creations such as online social networks and smart cities. Complex adaptive systems, or CAS, permeate everything. Of course, with a concept so massively ubiquitous, research and analysis of these systems is essential. While, the study of CAS is relatively recent (and will be discussed in detail in a future post), the most pertinent question is <em>why</em> do we study CAS? That will be answered in due time (approximately by the end of this post.)

How is the concept of CAS so ubiquitous? The short definition of a CAS is "a system that contains a large number of complex interacting entities, agents and environments, whose interactions lead to non-linear, aggregate, or self-similar properties". This covers the "complex" and "system" part of CAS, but how are these systems adaptive? Firstly, entities may possess adaptive functions. Secondly, agents can, through aggregate processes, cause an environment to adapt or evolve. Finally, both environments and agents, can create aggregate processes that cause the overall system to adapt.  

<!--Examples of CAS in the real world, how they are CAS and not CS-->
How does this definition apply to systems in reality? We'll use a common CAS as an example: an online social network!

Social networks such as Twitter, or Facebook, contain large numbers of interacting entities, through human (and some bots) users commenting, sharing, or 'liking' other user's posts. The users interact with the environment through making original posts on the service. These posts, shares, and 'likes' can contribute to emergent behaviours which may lead to communities forming.

<!--Why do we study CAS, what are some benefits?-->
So, why do we study CAS and what are the associated benefits? Firstly, understanding how these systems operate under certain conditions. ____
Secondly, determining how properties, such as aggregation or self-similarity, form and under which conditions these can occur or not. For certain real-world systems, being able to determine how and when an emergent behavior is likely to occur can lead to creation of methods which may dissuade or encourage the entities in the system from acheving this. 

<!--How do the benefits translate into real-world solutions?-->

<!--Next time-->
In the next post, I will be focusing on the history of CAS research and some key challenges that have yet to be resolved.
